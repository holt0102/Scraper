4.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay. So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.If you are still reading - here are the good sides (why I purchased this in spite of what I wrote above)A Mac is a Mac is a Mac. So is this one. The hardware are perfectly matched and performance is always optimal. This laptop is for carrying along as a second laptop, alongside my official one, a DELL workhorse. MAcbook Air is lightweight and can run other operating systems. I use this to run Windows and Linux.The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to ""buy"" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.Now coming back to my rating... I run mostly Windows and Linux on this MAC. Happy with it because the hardware is great. I consider myself a power user - so I know that I can find alternatives for this if and when Apple pulls the plug of support (should be available for at least another year, and a certain period after that as Apple's support to ""obsolete"" devices). Hence a durability rating of 3 stars only !!That (above) is the truth laid bare. Please decide and buy at your own risk.~~ Buy this if you like the hardware (but know that DELL or HP would give a much better hardware at this price, and those will be upgradable and last much longer than this)~~ Buy this because you understand that this hardware is very stable and Mac OS can protect your windows as it works in the MAC Shell. Buy this because you can run Linux once Mac makes this obsolete.~~ Do not buy this if you feel it adds to your premium value. It will be a dinosaur soon and you will be left stranded. Think of the plight of iPhone 5, which was premium 24 months ago. People rushed and purchased their ""cheap iPhone"" around a year back. Today, they have no pride in showing off a device that is obsolete. Tomorrow, Apple will make it sluggish and they will be forced to upgrade.EDIT/ADD [02/12/2019]: If you plan to upgrade your SSD to 500GB, please look at SSD (ASIN:B07J2WBKXF) with adapter (ASIN: B07D7VM8GM). I have been able to successfully upgrade myself. Review is on the SSD page.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally a MacBook possession. Got it in 50k in Diwali sale. Technically good laptop.Good News.luxury product, niche technology, good battery life, reliable machine (other laptops crash and become defunct in 6-10 years), no anti-virus required, security of data and transactions much better. Terrific sense of possession & pride.Bad News. Problems will be there if you are switching from windows based system - very less space in hard disk, no CD drive, inability to transfer data from Mac to your existing external hard disc unless you format it, apps are mostly paid and re unreasonably expensive (no free apps which are available otherwise on google play store, even the angry bird costs Rs 400 !!), all printers are not compatible (e.g. the most economical MFD laser printer RICOH SP 111 can't be used), huge compatibility issues with Pages (MS Word) and Keynote (powerpoint) unless you master it by working on these (still mostly the document and slides either do not open in windows environment or have distortion issues). you need to spend extra for an external CD writer and tp buy a carry bag. Mac con not be connected to most of the projectors unless you buy some connectors, which are expensive and theres no clarity which one to buy and from where. you can't connect it to your TV, the ports are different and again theres no clarity - customer support, manuals or help section are silent ! Marketing strategy for Indian market, if at all has been planned, has been very bad. If these critical issues (and a few more not mentioned here) are handled properly, the Mac can sweep away other laptops in India. Presently, it doesn't seem to be happening.Overall Verdict.If compatibility issues mentioned above do not bother you, go for it. Else, think hard.  If its an emotional issue to own a long cherished Mac, then its a different thing. Go ahead and gradually you would figure out most (but not all) of the above problems, like I did.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Laptop under 60k. If you don't want any accounting softwares like tally or busy then go for it, better than windows in every term. I just love it's battery life with sleek look üòçNow talking about MS officeIt's available on app store, free for 1 monthAfter that you will have to pay.You cannot install pirated version but if you install Windows 7 or any other version then u can use Ms office for freeBut in MacBook there are other apps which are good substitute for Ms office appsNumbers for ExcelPages for wordKeynote for PowerPointAnd you can convert your numbers file to Excel file or csv fileSame for the pages & keynoteSo no need of Ms office for me.Cons1. U cannot play games, your laptop will just heat up, battery will drain* U cannot play pubg mobile on emulator if you are pubg loverüòÅ2.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.Also, Get 10% Cashback by Ordering through vqr .in/24

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very upset about the product as I checked my MacBook 15 days back in December, it didn‚Äôt start. It was luckily in warranty . I took it to the service centre and they informed me the mother board and battery collapsed. If it was not in warranty I had to pay 47000/. I asked for replacement of the product and I was refused. They got it fixed for me. I don‚Äôt know why should I pay 57000/ for Mac quality. If this is the quality and the service, then I have to go to other product. In January my product expiry was due. They have give an extension of 3 months warranty when I had asked for 1 year. Very disappointed.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the Apple Macbook air on amazon discount sale.1) The OS is smooth and is a breeze to work with. Ships with macOS sierra but update is available to macOS mojave2) The design and build quality, as you can expect from an apple product is top notch.3) Excellen sound quality, keyboard.Cons:1) 128GB may be low incase you want to have movies and media in your laptop.You need to carry around a hard disk that kind of nullifies the advantage of having a light weight laptop.2) Display resolution is not exactly upto the mark

3.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a saying in our language which tells us everything degrades over time but I did not expect this to be true for an apple laptop of less than a year. My battery life which used to be around 12 hours when I bought this thing is now down to about 6And I watch less movies now and use more apps like word or Internet now than I did back then. I don't even play games on this!!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"if you're not doing any hardcore processing work like coding, video editing. MacBook Air is best for the normal everyday life use.- very good battery life- amazing OS- nice sound and video quality- processor is old but it do the work for basic tasks and doesn't heat up.If its in your budget go for it you wouldn't regret it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Couldn't have received a better laptop. Look Macs aren't for gaming.  So don't expect good gameplay. but if you really wanna get a performance, it will have it for you with a little heating.it surfs like a beast. if you do casual stuff like browsing or typing, you will be surprised. the fans rarely kick in.The battery is a bomb! Provides service all around the day with medium brightness. takes around 2-3 hrs to charge and man the safe charging system rocks. you will never tip off the mac.Editing is managed like a magical spell. no issue at all. BUT DON'T EXPECT IT TO SERVE LIKE A MACBOOK PRO, IT'S AIR.in terms of style, man it will rock you. Trust me, You won't regret.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"So after a year of using it, unfortunately the smc chip and memory synchronisation is at fault. There is no manual resetting that works and the only option is to get the chips replaced which costs around 19k. So much for long lasting.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"MacBook Air is excellent. The build is super strong, the operating systems runs smooth. The trackpad and keyboard are great. The only thing that can be improved is its screen (the visuals). Not as good as expected. The hard disk is too small but if you carry an external hard disk you can solve that problem. Got it at the price of a Dell Windows laptop during Amazon sale. A great deal.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"For a full year until the warranty was valid, this MacBook Air worked like a charm. Then it died. No response to power button. No internal mechanical movement. The laptop is just dead. I gave it for repair at an Apple authorized service center and they told me it was a failed Power Section and IC. I paid Rs. 13,300 for replacement and service charge of these parts only for the laptop to run fine for a couple of days and then die out in th same way. The dealer says I would have to pay the same amount to get the parts replaced again with no guarantees that the issue won't turn up again. Never trusting an Apple product again. For such a rich money hogging brand, they offer the shoddiest quality of service and products ever.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it on 9th July, stopped working / not turning power on by 4th Nov. Adding to this disappointment is - Apple's refusal to repair it under warranty stating that there is corrosion in Logic Board. Amazon also did not help. The seller - Appario - does not like to be bothered with it. Sometimes I wonder if buying electronics online is a good idea!

Except for not so good sound quality while watching movies through itunes stores, other aspect seems to be fine. Higher storage options (256 GB) may be required for power users who may want to app development on this system. Current configuration suits light - medium heavy user(I belong to this category)- (need xcode debugging feature for my projects ).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for an affordable long lasting light laptop and my search led me to this. I know Apple has launch a new Air but this is still a good performer and with the recent price cut this laptop makes so much sense. I was using MacBook Pro for last 8 years, and after it retired this replaced the Pro and is not doing a bad job at it at all.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy for the pride or quality advertised. The lapot keyboard failed just 2 days after the warrenty period. Service cost was 19,000. So I backed out and was using a USB keyboard. Now the whole system is not switching On. Took to local service center it has costed me 3,500 to just make it work again and still will cost more to make the keyboard replaced. Truly gutted. I have my HP laptop pro book almost 9 years old still running without any issues. Was planning to buy an IPhone but surely not after this. Deeply sad by the experience.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The MacBook is good in-terms of what it is designed for. The laptop is light weight so no hassle while carrying during travels. The backlit keyboard is a good advantage to work in low light. The performance is good, I use it for game development and I have not faced any problems until now. The transition from Windows to Mac was easy, not much of a hassle, initial few days, to understand the shortcut keys and how to operate will be little bit slow, post that it is just a breeze. Many applications are supported, no issue in bluetooth or USB connectivity or WIFI connectivity.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this product in February 2018 from Amazon. The power button started giving problems in end-May 2019. The computer just would not startup. I scanned the Net for such problems.  A lot of work arounds: push the Start button+ shift button etc. This worked for a few days. Then such work around too stopped working at all - the computed refused to start-up once shut down. Surprisingly, I ran the computer diagnostics on the Macbook, and the diagnostics program could not find any defect! I was surprised that even if the program could not find a defect on the computer, yet the computer once shut down would not start up.Secondly, finding a  Macbook authorised service center too is an onerous task in India. The Service center informed me that there is a problem with the mother board. And it needs to be replaced. Wow! Next time I would stick to my windows notebook, would never purchase a Macbook again!

This item was replaced with a brand new MacBook as per Amazon policy. However to my dismay, this new MacBook also had a similar defect, which was again certified by the service Engineer. Apple is the world leader in laptops, and what amazes me is the 'QC' or the lack of it.Finally I had to request Amazon to refund the amount, which they did.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:Air demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for 52K during Amazon Sale. I can say that this is the best budget friendly Macbook ever.I have been a windows user for a very long time and always wanted to try a Mac because the whole world uses it. I used to be an Apple critic. But after using it for months, I can say that I am never going back to Windows again.The only thing Windows does better is gaming. Buy a Windows if you care about gaming. For everything else, Mac should be your preference. If you are looking forward to developing iOS or Mac apps, Mac is the only way.It is much more faster, responsive and sturdy than my Windows laptop. The OS never crashes and the performance is just flawless. Meanwhile my Windows laptop crashes very often ( Blue screen of death, Unwanted updates, driver incompatibility etc). I receive free OS updates every now and then and there has never been a compatibility issue.Apple - You just earned a new customer for life. Just make sure you don‚Äôt keep increasing the prices as it is the only con I can think of.TL;DR - If you want a laptop that is not going to irritate you every now and then and your budget is 50-60K. Wait for the sale and go for this Mac. But remember - This is not for gaming. For that, buy windows

Highly impressed by its fit and finish.I feel MacbookAir is a perfect device for personal use. Now a days, we use personal laptops majorly for browsing and streaming online contents and sometimes documentation of personal stuff. MacbookAir serves this purpose brilliantly. Its core i5 processor is faster and crispier enough to deliver that ultra-fast performance. Sound quality is crystal clear with stereo effect. Battery backup is sufficient for a longer sitting.Its light weight and sleek design makes it easy to maneuver anywhere anytime.Totally a value for money product for me.This trustworthy combo of Apple and Amazon made this purchase (verified on apple india website) an authentic one.Thanks for your patience. Hope this helps.

In about 2 months, there were constant shut down restart issues -- the device was with service centre for a week and they promised it was just a software issue and it was sorted. Today, after 3 weeks of working  fine, the laptop is completely dead. It won't power on!! The Apple support guy wants to replace the mother board... This is my 4-5th laptop in about 12-13 years. I used only windows before this but never had so many problems so early on with any laptop. I don't think I'll ever buy Mac again. And certainly not from an online reseller.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost all laptops with an 8gb ram is above 45K adding another 10k to buy MacBook Air makes absolute sense if you compare the1. physical size of the other laptops2. If you are in search for a laptop don't skip air before actually going to an Apple Store and checking it physically3. You can install windows in MacBook Air, from 2016 apple is officially supporting installation of windows in Mac OS via Bootcamp software it comes preinstalled and all you have to do is point out the path of windows OS and dual boot. And the installation is absolute cakewalk no tech exp needed.4. The booting time is super fast since it works on SSD5. The resolution is std 1440x900 but the output is crisp and you won't feel much of a difference until you are familiar with Retina display.6. The apple logo on the lid is still a headturner7. The keyboard is best in class and is much better than the MacBook Pro, it also have backlit keys which makes better experience during odd working hours.8. browsing and reading websites are much better than the windows anyday.9. You won't find the need to have a mouse with the multi touch recon keypad.10.YOu will adapt to macOS in less than 15 mins.11. The inbuilt speaker is awesome, you will wonder how can this thin device can deliver loud and crisp sound.12. Impressed with the charger cable of MacBook its called MagSafe connector, it completely avoids the damage to laptop by tripping onto charger cable.Cons:128GB storage only, but since I have a 1TB connector and don't store movies and songs can use it smoothly with adequate softwares.No much colours to choose from the only color is silver but the looks are classy

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome laptop. Super slim. Great battery. Great screen. Working for hours does not harm the eyes, for some reason the low resolution screen seems very beneficial for eyes and long hours of work. Reading text and viewing movies/pictures both seem good and comfortable. I bought it during the sale for 44K. Ordered at 6 AM in the morning. Got it delivered by 7 PM in the evening. Same day delivery. Flawless service. Best laptop that I have seen and used since last 25 years. I like Windows. So immediately I installed Windows also in a separate partition. I have now both MacOS and Windows running on MacBook Air. MacOS is best for non-techie people. Amazing multi-touch trackpad. Keyboard with adjustable backlight is great. 128GB SSD memory makes both Windows and MacOS run very fast. I have also installed Visual Studio, SQL Server on Windows side. Performs very well. No issues at all even for coding work and resource hungry Visual Studio. Apple is great after all.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is what it is and there is nothing to review about its capabilities. I wanted a MacBook and after looking at multiple outlets for prices amazon had the best pricing for this product. (With offers combined)I ordered the product on prime and there was a deficit on stock and by that delayed my delivery by a couple of days. Other than that the product was as expected. Delivery was smooth and as expected. The retailer is Appario retail and to my knowledge is an amazon subsidiary.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bad power management when I play music on the speakers. Heats up soon when I play video games. This of course is seen in many other reviews, and technically, this laptop is not built for playing games with. This could still be a set back for the machine.
